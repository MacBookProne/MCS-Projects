## Montana Code School Frontend Developer Course 2023

This is a repo for my Montana Code School Projects.

This is an 18-week course.

### Week 1 Information

#### Purpose
The purpose of each coding assignment is to help you master the concepts presented each week by answering problems using those concepts.

#### Due Date
Each Coding Assignment is due by midnight on Saturday.

#### Late Policy
Assignments turned in late will result in a 10% deduction of points.

#### Tips
- Start the assignment early in the week and before your live class.
- Bring questions to your class, to office hours, or a mentor session.
- Be sure to follow all instructions as there are no resubmissions or regrades.

#### Instructions
1. In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
2. Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
3. Record and Upload a Video showcasing your assignment.
4. Keep Track of the URL for this week's Video upload.
5. Start the Quiz to submit your assignment.
6. Put the URL for your Video into the Quiz.
7. Answer the questions.

#### Coding Steps
Create a website using only HTML. The website can be anything you like (within school guidelines) if it meets the following criteria:
- At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page.
- 2 different size headers, a list, 3 images, a table, and a form.

#### Video Steps
Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
- This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
- This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
- You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
- This will create a video recording on your computer.
- This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
- Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
- If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.

### Prompts for this week
Prompts:
- What are semantic tags in HTML, and why are they important?
- HTML Validation: Explore the importance of HTML validation and how it can help ensure well-formed and error-free web pages. Provide a small contextual example.
- Explore the role of meta tags in HTML for SEO. Research common meta tags such as <title>, <meta name="description">, and <meta name="keywords">. Investigate their impact on search engine rankings and best practices for optimizing them.
- What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

This research assignment aims to extend your knowledge beyond the course curriculum by delving into relevant topics and familiarizing you with online resources commonly used in professional settings.

As developers, conducting research is an integral part of our job. While the saying that 90% of software development is "Googling" may be an exaggeration, search engines are indeed indispensable tools in our role.

A recommended resource to start your research is the JavaScript web documentation (MDN), but there are numerous other valuable sources available as well!

## Instructions
1. Choose at least two (2) of the prompts provided.
2. Conduct research on the chosen prompts.
3. Write at least one paragraph for each of the selected prompts.
4. Include the URLs of the sources you used to cite your information.
5. Submit your research results through the Learning Management System (LMS).

### Please Note
- Avoid copying and pasting text directly from the internet or any other sources.
- Utilize the information you gather during your research as a foundation, summarizing the concepts in your own words to aid in understanding and retention.
- Plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment and may lead to disciplinary actions.
